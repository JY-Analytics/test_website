    "Overall, shorter songs tend to be more popular because they can be played more times in same time span. Indeed, with a catchy 2min song, you may want to play it consecutively to get your fix of the melody. There is evidence that the average length of songs on pop charts has been getting shorter for this reason.\n",

    "1) There are some pretty awesome open data sources and APIs out there. I was really impressed by the effort made to create https://exportify.net/\n",

    "2) Cleaning data is often an iterative process. I found myself continously returning to the data prep section to refine my data after running into problems and bugs with my analysis.\n",

For example, in this data set, I did not have data on musical genre or other data about the artists themselves. It would have also been interesting to get data on other users to see how my music taste compares to the average user."
